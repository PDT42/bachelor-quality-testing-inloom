% TODO: Explain what INLOOM is and does here, or in related work?

\section[Motivation]{Motivation}

2020 was jinxed. The Covid-19 pandemic changed how our lives work.
It has presented the globalised world with little anticipated challenges
and we can feel its influence almost every aspect of our everyday life. 
In order to reduce the amount of human contacts as much as possible, every 
aspect of human interaction was evaluated for its digitizability. However: 
We were all forced to witness, that our digital infracstructe is most obiously 
not yet up to the task of enabling us to \textit{live the remote life}.

Most of the fundamental problems were trivialities, like missing webcams or 
a too slow internet connection. Where such were taken care of, the harder-to-fix
problems came to light. Problems like inadequately educated overtaxed personnel 
and missing software solutions, that comply with european digital privacy regulation. 
Even though at first glance the personnel problems don't seem to matter much to 
software developers, it are still problems, which can and will, at least in part,
be resolved by them. \\

I don't want to claim, that the digitization of everyday life was a complete
failure though. Like me, most office workers were able to migrate to home office 
without much fuss. Still: Living the life of a remote student for half a year,
definitely motivates me, to spend some thought on how to make e-teaching a 
little better. 

Even though it prooved hazardous sometimes, working with existing e-teaching 
tools made me realize, what huge potential lies within a properly digitized higher
eduaction. Such would not only help temper the effects emergencies, like the covid
pandemic, have on university life, but will also be a powerful tool in futureproofing
universities for the challenges of rising student numbers in the years to come.

Intelligent-Tutoring-Systems like INLOOM, and ITS under active developement at TU 
Dresden will make the increased workload managable for university personnel. 
Developers are required to produce software that is as intuitive as possible, provides
a decent grade of digital security, complies with privacy regulations, handles high 
traffic without complain and all that, while providing an unquestionably accurate and 
fair environment for everyone involved. 

Integrating digital resources into the workflow seamlessly, will enable teaching 
personnel to still be able to focus on the individual student, when the student
groups they teach become way bigger, than they are today - Which, in the end, could be
the only way to keep higher education as we know it affordable. By contributing to 
INLOOM, I contribute to digitizing education.

\section[Research Questions]{Research Questions}

The goal of this thesis is finding or developing a concept for validating evaluations,
INLOOM generates for student created UML-models (autoEval), in order to ensure the correctness
and fairness of said evaluations. Since not all mistakes, a student could make are predictable,
it will not be possible to ensure, that the automatic grading INLOOM performs, finds all
errors a student solution contains. Therefore it will not be achievable to perform an 
objective evaluation of INLOOMs results. 
\\

The only remaining option is performing a relative evaluation, a comparison of INLOOMs 
results with the best evaluation of the same model we know. These best evaluations, 
in INLOOMs case, are manual ones of the same student solution, created by human tutors 
(manEval). This in turn means, that the possibilities for validating INLOOMs results, 
are severely limited by the availability and ascertainability of the underlying data.
\\

For the purpose of validating INLOOMs evaluations I will aim to answer the following
research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1}] Which values can be extracted from the manual and automatic evaluations?
    \item[\textbf{RQ2}] What comparative scale is qualified to provide a conclusive impression
    on the quality of the evaluations INLOOM generates? 
    \item[\textbf{RQ3}] How can the developer/tutor/instructor best be assisted in collecting
    and preprocessing the evaluation data, required for the quality validation? 
    \item[\textbf{RQ4}] How can the results of the comparison of man- and autoEval be presented
    to greatest effect? 
\end{itemize}

The answer to RQ1 will determine which values are available to facilitate a comparison
between man- and autoEval. The question is approached with an analysis of the available
datasets.
The second reaserch question focusses on what to do with the data, once it is collected.
Assuming, that comparable data can be extracted from both man- and autoEval (so basically
that RQ1 can be answered successfully), a way to combine the found relative differences
between the two evaluations, into a conclusive quality score, is still required.
Answering the question will be approached by performing a literature survey, concerning the
quality validation methodologie, of existing ITS and automatic grading methods.
Under any envisionable circumstances, it will be necessary, to digitize manEvals a tutor
created for student solutions. This digitization process entails a high amount of overhead 
for the creation of testcasess, that should be reduced as much as possible. Research Question
three (RQ3), aims to resolve this problem and will be tackled by an analysis of the test-creation
process, which will determine the, most workload intensive, steps of the process. These steps 
can then be considered in the design of the software solution proposed in this thesis.
Lastly it remains to be determined how to best present or visualize the results of the meta 
evaluation (the evaluation of the evalutions) to the developer/tutor/instructor.
This is the reason why RQ4 is listed among the research questions. Answering it, will depend
greatly on the answer to RQ2.
